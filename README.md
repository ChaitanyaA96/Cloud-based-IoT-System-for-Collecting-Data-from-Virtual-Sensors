# Cloud-based-IoT-System-for-Collecting-Data-from-Virtual-Sensors

This project aims to demonstrate how to create a cloud-based IoT system that collects data from virtual sensors using the MQTT protocol. 
The system uses Python programming language to simulate virtual environmental stations and sends data to a cloud-based backend using MQTT. 
The backend used in this project is Thingsboard.
